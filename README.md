The codes in this repo are not end to end complete because of this repo contains the which i contributed in the whole Project.
The code is divided into two part:- 1) Fisrt is the jupyter file which contain code of training and test of DeepLabV3 resnet101 model, the code is modified version of from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/balraj98/deeplabv3-resnet101-for-segmentation-pytorch#Training-DeepLabV3+-with-Pretrained-ResNet101-Encoder
2) Is my 100% original code which takes segmented image and calculate the area and wkt polygon of the area from the centroid coordinate of the image. the code saves these areas and polygon coordinates geojson file automatically.
