The codes in this repo are not end-to-end complete because this repo contains the which I contributed to the whole Project.
The code is divided into two parts:- 1) Fisrt is the jupyter file which contains code of training and test of DeepLabV3 resnet101 model, the code is a modified version from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/balraj98/deeplabv3-resnet101-for-segmentation-pytorch#Training-DeepLabV3+-with-Pretrained-ResNet101-Encoder

2) Is my 100% original code which takes the segmented image and calculates the area and wkt polygon of the area from the centroid coordinate of the image. the code saves these areas and the polygon coordinates geojson file automatically.


the documentation file contains a detailed plan and code execution of the whole project.
